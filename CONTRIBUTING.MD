# Contributing

Do you want to contribute? I'd love that.

MY goal is to have links that are in line with ALX curriculum, right from foundation to specialization and useful to many students.

## How?

The easiest way is to click [README](./README.md) and click on the "pen" icon in the upper right corner. Make the changes to the file and follow the instructions to create a pull request.
